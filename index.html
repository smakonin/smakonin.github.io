                                        <p>My research uses data science techniques to solve computational sustainability problems using probabilistic models and inference algorithms. Computational sustainability is an interdisciplinary field that solves problems by balancing ecological, economic, and social needs.</p>
                                        <p>There are two parts to any approach. The theoretical aspects of algorithm design are needed to understand the limitations of a given algorithm. The data analytics aspects are equally important because there may be inherent traits within the data that can allow for an optimized implementation of a limiting algorithm, such as the inherent exponentiality of an HMM. With the global consensus that our demand for energy is growing at an unsustainable rate (both economically and ecologically) energy conservation is an integral part of any solution. Manufacturing billions of sensors to monitor the energy of every appliance in every home is equally unsustainable. Computational solutions (both algorithmic and data analytical) need to part of any energy conservation solution.</p>

                                                        <p>Cognitive Radio is a novel method of radio communication which enables more efficient use of the frequency spectrum. This efficiency is achieved by dynamically allocating frequency bands within the spectrum to different users. Within the field of Cognitive Radio, many different aspects of the system must be considered in order to achieve an optimal system. This includes methods for sensing whether the spectrum is available, sensing which channel is best for use, determining the time required to transmit data, and determining protocols which ensure all users achieve an adequate quality of service. This paper reviews a section of current topics in Cognitive Radio research on how cognition is used to make optimal channel selection. Paper compares various methods and identifies significance of various options and their efficiencies.</p>

As the popularity of NILM grows, we find that there is no consistent way the researchers are measuring and reporting accuracies.

                                                        <p>Understanding how the electrical appliances and devices in a house consume power is an important factor that can allow occupants to make intelligent and informed decisions about conserving energy. This is often not an easy task. These electrical loads can turn ON and OFF either by the actions of occupants, or by automatic sensing and actuation (e.g. thermostat). Even if we could keep track of when loads turned ON and OFF, it is difficult to understand how much a load consumes at any given operational state because of the lack of proper measurement reporting within equipment manuals. Occupants could buy sensors that would help, but this comes at a high financial cost. Power utility companies around the world are now replacing old electro-mechanical meters with digital meters (smart meters) that have enhanced communication capabilities. These smart meters are essentially a free sensor that offer an opportunity to use computation to infer what loads are currently running in a house and to estimate how much each load is consuming, a process often referred to as load disaggregation.</p>
                                                		<p>This thesis presents a new load disaggregation algorithm (i.e. a disaggregator). This new disaggregator uses a super-state hidden Markov model and a new Viterbi algorithm variant which preserves dependencies between loads and can disaggregate multi-state loads, all while performing computationally efficient exact inference. Our sparse Viterbi algorithm can efficiently compute sparse matrices with a large number of super-states. Our disaggregator is the first of its kind to run in real-time on an inexpensive embedded processor using low sampling rates (e.g. per minute). Other contributions of the research include an analysis of electrical measurements, the release of a publicly available dataset, and a method for comprehensive accuracy testing and reporting.</p>

                                                        <p>Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a process of discerning  what appliances are running within a house from processing the power or current signal of a smart meter. Since appliance states are not observed directly, hidden Markov models (HMM) are a natural choice for modelling NILM appliances. However, because the number of HMM states grows rapidly with the number of appliances and their internal states, existing methods have relied on either simplifying the model (e.g. factorial HMM) or reducing the number of appliance states (e.g. considering only on/off states), all of which reduces the accuracy of NILM. In this paper we present a new NILM algorithm that can handle multiple internal appliance states while still keeping complexity in check by utilizing the sparsity of HMM emission and transition matrices. The results show overall accuracy results of 95% for both classification and estimation using the AMPds dataset.</p>

                                                        <p>Sustainable energy supply and demand can partially be solved by the conservation of energy, which is a personal and self-driven action. However, energy conservation currently requires the purchase of third-party products. The upfront cost of purchasing these products to monitor energy consumption in a home is a barrier that further cements the divide of those that have and those that have not. Detailed appliance power consumption reporting should be made available for free as part of the home’s smart meter. Governments and power utilities must improve and expand policies that promote a socio-economic balance allowing everyone to participate in energy conservation regardless of their economic situation in a sustained way. We critically look at what economics and government polices exist and need to exist. We also demonstrate the computational means to achieve this &mdash; nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) &mdash; and discuss how manufacturing and standards organizations need to work together to provide the essential information that describes how appliances consume energy. This paper proposes a Consumer Bill of Rights for Energy Conservation.</p>

Wireless sensor networks that communicate in a mesh acquire and transmit such critical parameters, making a medical environment efficient. With limited resources, both equipment and medical staff, the system must be reliable, and capable of dynamic updating on patient status. System must be able to sustain at least single contingency. We designed a signal conditioning circuit and firmware that converts finger pulse into beats per minute (BPM), which is then displayed on a remote station dynamically via ZigBee. Testing was performed to measure the reliability of transmitting data over a wide range of distances through high traffic areas (both human and Wi-Fi). We show that such systems can provided enhanced reliability in a limited resourced environment and have the potential to be deployed in disaster recovery situations.</p>

Attached to the poster is a cover that hides the NIML disaggregation chart of appliances (see poster 1). The poster was laminated so that the smart meter data chart could be marked using dry erase markers. Once the audience members finished trying to guess what appliances turned ON/OFF and when, they could open the cover to view the NILM chart (poster 2). The audience members could then compare the marked-up smart meter data chart to the NILM chart.</p>

These digital power meters have enhanced communication capabilities, but they are not actually smart. We present the cognitive power meter (c-meter), a meter that is actually smart. By using load disaggregation intelligence, c-meter is the realization of demand response and other smart grid energy conservation initiatives. Our c-meter is made of two key components: a prototype open source ammeter and an optimized embedded load disaggregation algorithm (&mu;Disagg). Additionally, we provide an open source multi-circuit ammeter array that can build probabilistic appliance (or load) consumption models that are used by the c-meter. &mu;Disagg is the first load disaggregation algorithm to be implemented on an inexpensive low-power embedded processor that runs in real-time using a typical/basic smart meter measurement (current, in A). &mu;Disagg can disaggregate loads with complex power states with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

But, a smart meter is only a digital power meter with enhanced communications capabilities &mdash; it is not actually smart. We need to look beyond the smart meter and define what intelligence is needed to actually make a meter smart. One area with promise is load disaggregation. Load disaggregation can be used to determine what loads contributing to the consumption reading at the smart meter. A smart meter incorporating load disaggregation intelligence can be seen as going beyond the traditional smart meter &mdash; what we call a cognitive power meter (c-meter). However, using load disaggregation, in its current form, is not feasible. We critically review the requirements for a c-meter and provide insights as to how load disaggregation research needs to change to make the c-meters a reality.</p>

                                                        <p>Research has shown that small changes in behavior in how we use our homes can result in substantial energy and water savings. Home automation and the integration of computational intelligence capabilities in the “smart home” are often cited as promising advances in the design and renovation of efficient buildings. However, the design and implementation of such technologies are largely based on energy-use simulations, smart automation of the building systems, and components for optimal performance rather than on effectively supporting how people use their homes. Additional factors, including system complexity and awkward automation, can discourage acceptance of smart home technologies. In this article, the authors propose that technological support for sustainable home use lies in more subtle and contextually appropriate interventions that integrate more informative models of occupant behavior, provide hybrid levels of automated control, and use ambient sensing for localized decisions. They discuss several cases from their experience in designing sustainable home systems and describe two current design cases for ambient intelligence in home control.</p>

                                                        <p>For decades the electric grid has remained a passive system that has delivered electricity to many households and businesses. As utility companies look at converting a passive electric grid to a smart grid, a number of sensors and smart meters must be deployed throughout the grid system to achieve this objective. Deploying vast amounts of sensors and smart meters becomes a costly and timely affair. If these sensors are strategically placed we might be able to minimize the amount of sensors used (saving cost and time) to derive the same information. This information can consist of alarms and notifications about such things as: electricity theft and unexpected rises in consumption.</p>
                                                        <p>A visualization technique for presenting nodal trees over a satellite map image was used to allow the placement of sensors and connect them as they would be physically connected on the power grid. Recursive analysis was used at the selected node to examine the power reading of child nodes at display a summary of power differences. Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) algorithms could then be used to identify ares of power losses for further investigation. The NILM algorithms could then be actively tuned using a man-in-the-middle approach via feedback for the visualization application.</p>

In particular, it is important to understand what appliances are being used and when. In the computational sustainability research community this is known as load disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM). NILM is a foundational algorithm that can disaggregate a home’s power usage into the individual appliances that are running, identify energy conservation opportunities. This depth report will focus on NILM algorithms, their use and evaluation. We will examine and evaluate the anatomy of NILM, looking at techniques using load monitoring, event detection, feature ex- traction, classification, and accuracy measurement.</p>

                                                        <p>As people become more concerned with the need to conserve their power consumption we need to find ways to inform them of how electricity is being consumed within the home. There are a number of devices that have been designed using different forms, sizes, and technologies. We are interested in large ambient displays that can be read at a glance and from a distance as informative art. However, from these objectives come a number of questions that need to be explored and answered. To what degree might lifestyle factors influence the design of eco-visualizations? To answer this we need to ask how people with varying lifestyle factors perceive the utility of such devices and their placement within a home. We explore these questions by creating four ambient display prototypes. We take our prototypes and subject them to a user study to gain insight as to the questions posed above. This paper discusses our prototypes in detail and the results and findings of our user study.</p>

                                                        <p>Smart homes of the future will have a number of different types of sensors. What types of sensors and how they will be used depends on the behaviour needed from the smart home. Using the sensors to automatically determine if a home is occupied can lead to a wide range of benefits. For example, it could trigger a change in the thermostat setting to save money, or even a change in security monitoring systems. Our prototype Home Occupancy Agent (HOA), which we present in this paper, uses a rule based system that monitors power consumption from meters and ambient light sensor readings in order to determine occupancy. The agent is also able to determine when the occupants are asleep, and thus provide the potential for further energy saving opportunities.</p>

If Aemass cannot eat food at a rate greater than or equal to the rate that it excretes waste Aemass will slowly shrink and then die; therefore, an unsustainable environment. Can we make this environment self- sustainable? If so, how? What if Aemass is really not an organism, but a swarm of robots. What emergent behaviours would it have?</p>

Ambient displays can be used as an eco-feedback technology to convey household consumption information. Elements of Consumption (EoC) demonstrates this by visualizing electricity, water, and natural gas consumption. EoC delivers three key components: (1) an abstract art piece, (2) a visual way to display data, and (3) to use an abstract art piece as a visual way to display data in order to persuade homeowners to conserve.</p>

                                                        <p>This project was an attempt to create and study an online social network that had a common interest. More specifically we wanted to take a segment of the BCIT community, both employees and students, and provide to them a way to share bike routes they use to travel back and forth to BCIT.</p>
                                                		<p>Map with Wheels utilizes the Facebook social networking software and uses Google Maps to add, edit, and display bike routes and Points of Interest (POI). POIs, such as hazards, controlled intersections, cut- throughs, and other user defined points help describe various situations that may be encountered while taking a particular bike route. Discussion groups further foster communication amongst users as to their experiences while taking a particular bike route. Each route can then be rated in terms of: directness, flatness, control, and traffic volume.</p>
