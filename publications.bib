@article{makonin_ampds2,
	Abstract = {With the cost of consuming resources increasing (both economically and ecologically), homeowners need to find ways to curb consumption. The Almanac of Minutely Power dataset Version 2 (AMPds2) has been released to help computational sustainability researchers, power and energy engineers, building scientists and technologists, utility companies, and eco-feedback researchers test their models, systems, algorithms, or prototypes on real house data. In the vast majority of cases, real-world datasets lead to more accurate models and algorithms. AMPds2 is the first dataset to capture all three main types of consumption (electricity, water, and natural gas) over a long period of time (2 years) and provide 11 measurement characteristics for electricity. No other such datasets from Canada exist. Each meter has 730 days of captured data. We also include environmental and utility billing data for cost analysis. AMPds2 data has been pre-cleaned to provide for consistent and comparable accuracy results amongst different researchers and machine learning algorithms.},

Successful apps require people, both managers and developers, to have a deep understanding of software engineering. This chapter will focus on the many aspects of software engineering for creating apps for smart building management systems. Readers will get an overview of the many different issues to consider when developing apps and what some of the problems are to avoid. We will discuss the types of apps that can be considered for creation and discuss how they are used. This chapter serves as a primer for understanding apps and app development.},

@article{klemenjak_transferability,
	Abstract = {To assess the performance of load disaggregation algorithms it is common practise to train a candidate algorithm on data from one or multiple households and subsequently apply cross-validation by evaluating the classification and energy estimation performance on unseen portions of the dataset derived from the same households. With an emerging discussion of transferability in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM), there is a need for domain-specific metrics to assess the performance of NILM algorithms on new test scenarios being unseen buildings. In this paper, we discuss several metrics to assess the generalisation ability of NILM algorithms. These metrics target different aspects of performance evaluation in NILM and are meant to complement the traditional performance evaluation approach. We demonstrate how our metrics can be utilised to evaluate NILM algorithms by means of two case studies. We conduct our studies on several energy consumption datasets and take into consideration five state-of-the-art as well as four baseline NILM solutions. Finally, we formulate research challenges for future work.},

@inproceedings{makonin_ecovis,
	Abstract = {As people become more concerned with the need to conserve their power consumption we need to find ways to inform them of how electricity is being consumed within the home. There are a number of devices that have been designed using different forms, sizes, and technologies. We are interested in large ambient displays that can be read at a glance and from a distance as informative art. However, from these objectives come a number of questions that need to be explored and answered. To what degree might lifestyle factors influence the design of eco-visualizations? To answer this we need to ask how people with varying lifestyle factors perceive the utility of such devices and their placement within a home. We explore these questions by creating four ambient display prototypes. We take our prototypes and subject them to a user study to gain insight as to the questions posed above. This paper discusses our prototypes in detail and the results and findings of our user study.},
